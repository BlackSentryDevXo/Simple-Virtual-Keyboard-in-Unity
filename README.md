# Simple-Virtual-Keyboard-in-Unity
A simple virtual keyboard to use for a hangman type of game or any project at all

Setting up this simple system with any project should be easy.
You can create a canvas and create a new gameobject under the canvas, then you attach the virtual keyboard script to it and fill in the required components in the inspector
Then you now create a text mesh pro button and add the virtual letter script to it and fill in the required components in the inspector
Create a prefab out of the letter object and assign that prefab to the virtual keyboard in the inspector
